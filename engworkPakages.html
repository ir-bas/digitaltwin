    <h4>Project management plan</h4>
    <p>
      The project team will be responsible for the implementation of the project activities.
      The project activities are distributed among the members of the scientific team as follows:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Assistant Professor, Ph.D. Penio Dimitrov Lebamovski, IR-BAS – project leader.
        <br><u>Scientific tasks</u> – Coordination of scientific research. Creation of a 3D extreme game model.
        Development of algorithms to create the game. Participation in the development of a methodology for determining
        the fractal and multifractal properties of cardiac signals registered in different stressful situations.
        Organization of publication activity.
      </li>
