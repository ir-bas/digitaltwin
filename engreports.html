                <strong>Project management and reporting.</strong><br>
                Timely submission of reports for all Work Packages and Project Stages.
                Development of a comprehensive methodology for project sustainability and risk management.
                Achievement of the planned scientific results with high quality, delivered on time
                and in compliance with ethical regulations and the protection of volunteers’ data.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Methodological framework for HRV analysis.</strong><br>
                Development, testing and validation of a new methodological framework for HRV analysis,
                integrating classical, fractal, entropic and nonlinear methods into a unified concept.
                Proven effectiveness and universality of the framework for real-world data.
                The framework will include a minimal yet informative set of indicators capable of reliably
                distinguishing physiological, stress-induced and pre-risk states.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Synthetic cardiological data.</strong><br>
                Objective assessment of the advantages and limitations of different approaches
                for generating cardiological data and selection of the most effective and reliable
                method for practical application.
                Formulation of principles and criteria for building synthetic databases with high
                physiological fidelity and sufficient variability and statistical coverage
                for training and validation of AI algorithms.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>New indicators, dependencies and biomarkers.</strong><br>
                Discovery of new indicators and correlations enabling more accurate assessment
                and differentiation of physiological states.
                Identification of new dependencies between HRV parameters and physiological states
                (rest, cognitive load, stress, pre-risk states) that cannot be clearly revealed by
                classical methods.
                Definition of potential biomarkers and combined indices for improved state stratification.
                Identification of new regularities and latent factors that enrich existing knowledge
                of autonomic regulation and serve as a basis for personalized AI models and digital twins.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>VR/MR as a research tool.</strong><br>
                Establishment of a scientific rationale for considering VR/MR environments
                as an independent research problem.
                Definition of criteria for reliability, applicability and reproducibility
                of virtual stimuli in the study of psychophysiological responses.
            </li>

            <li>
